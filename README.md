This is the [Uncle Nagy's House](http://unclenagyshouse.com) for tvOS. It's a really simple TVMLKit app built with information gleaned from [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/114886/beginning-tvos-development-with-tvml-tutorial) and [Apple's sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/samplecode/TVMLCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html).

[It uses Gulp](https://github.com/kenmickles/unh_tvos/blob/master/client/gulpfile.coffee) to turn Coffeescript into TVJS and Jade into TVML.
